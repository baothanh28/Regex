Experience of regex
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2503413/regular-expression-to-stop-at-first-match

The other answers here fail to spell out a full solution for regex versions which don't support non-greedy matching.

If your stopping condition is a single character, the solution is easy; instead of
a(.*?)b you can match  a[^ab]*b



To match with a or b [ab]
